<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial request was to set up the frontend folder. This evolved into a series of UI/UX improvement tasks.
**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  Set up the frontend repository, which was nested incorrectly.
2.  Improve the UI of the Farmer Dashboard, specifically the Google Translate selector and the initial empty state.
3.  Fix an API connection error on the Farmer Dashboard by replacing a hardcoded  URL with the correct backend URL ().
4.  Implement a full-featured Retailer Dashboard, similar to an existing Mandi page, with multiple tabs (Profile, Items, Orders) and corresponding API endpoints for CRUD operations.
5.  Ensure the UI/UX is excellent, with visualizations and a good color theme.
6.  Fix the login flow to redirect retailers to their dashboard () instead of a landing page ().
7.  Enhance the Retailer Dashboard with map integration for order tracking, real-time updates, and more advanced analytics with better graphs.
8.  Perform a Neo-Industrial Brutalist redesign of the platform, while maintaining distinct color themes for each user role (e.g., teal for retailer).
9.  Create a visually appealing, animated 404 Not Found page.
10. Redesign the 404 page to match the main website's theme.
11. Enhance the main landing page with 3D animations.
12. Create a new 404 page based on a user-provided image, with a green theme.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The frontend has been set up correctly, with dependencies installed and services running via supervisor.

The application features several role-based dashboards:
-   **Farmer Dashboard**: UI has been improved, and a critical API URL bug has been fixed.
-   **Retailer Dashboard**: A comprehensive multi-tab dashboard has been built, featuring Overview, Inventory, Orders, Analytics, and Profile sections with full CRUD functionality. It has been enhanced with real-time data refresh and placeholders for advanced analytics and maps. A Neo-Industrial Brutalist redesign has been partially implemented on this dashboard.
-   **Home Page**: Enhanced with 3D animations.
-   **404 Page**: A custom 404 page exists and has been styled to match the main site's theme.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user requested a complete redesign of the 404 page, providing a specific image as a visual reference and asking for it to have a green color theme. The agent was about to begin analyzing the image and implementing this new page.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: The Neo-Industrial Brutalist redesign of the Retailer Dashboard is incomplete. While the new sidebar and Overview tab shell are in place, the content of the Overview tab and the entire Inventory, Orders, Analytics, and Profile tabs still use the old design, creating a visual inconsistency. This was caused by the agent partially completing the redesign task before moving to another user request. (Priority: P1)

Issues Detail:
-   Issue 1:
    -   Attempted fixes: The agent successfully implemented the new sidebar and the basic structure for the redesign. A syntax error that occurred during this process was also fixed. However, the redesign was not applied to all sections of the dashboard.
    -   Next debug checklist:
        -   File: 
        -   Task: Apply the Neo-Industrial Brutalist aesthetic (dark theme, sharp corners, mono fonts, specific color variables) to the content within the , , , and  tabs.
        -   Ensure the role-specific color theme (teal for retailer) is used as the primary accent color within the new design.
    -   Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To complete the user-requested visual overhaul, ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across the entire Retailer Dashboard.
    -   Status: IN PROGRESS
    -   Is recurring issue? N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
    -   Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Complete the Neo-Industrial Brutalist redesign of the Retailer Dashboard. (Priority: P1)

Task Detail:
-   Task 1:
    -   Where to resume: In , continue implementing the new design for the , , , and  tab components, following the established aesthetic from the  hook and the partially completed Overview tab.
    -   What will be achieved with this? A visually cohesive and fully redesigned Retailer Dashboard that aligns with the user's explicit design direction.
    -   Status: IN PROGRESS
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
    -   Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, Chart.js, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** FastAPI (inferred)
- **Database:** MongoDB (inferred)
- **Tooling:**  for process management

**key DB schema**
-   No database changes were made. All interactions were based on the API contract provided by the user for the retailer endpoints.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main focus of recent work, containing the multi-tab dashboard and the partial redesign.
-   : Modified to fix the retailer login redirect.
-   : Created and will be the target of the next task.
-   : Enhanced with 3D animations.
-   : Modified to include the 404 route.
-   : New hook created to manage the brutalist redesign theme.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has grown very large. It should be refactored by splitting each tab's content into its own component (e.g., , ) to improve readability and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   **Base URL:** 
-   **Retailer Endpoints:**
    -    (GET, PUT)
    -    (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    -    (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate priority is to **build the new green-themed 404 page** based on the user-provided image.
-   The user has a strong focus on aesthetics. A Neo-Industrial Brutalist redesign was approved for the Retailer Dashboard. This redesign is **half-finished** and must be completed.
-   Crucially, while implementing the brutalist design, you must adhere to the user's rule of **maintaining role-specific accent colors** (teal for retailer).
-   The  file is in a transitional state and needs to be handled carefully to complete the redesign across all its tabs.
